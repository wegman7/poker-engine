    - we need to write a list of all the game pauses we want, then use finite stat machine concepts to write blocks of code that will execute separate from our game loop
        - we can use goroutines for them to execute independently and not block our game loop, but pausing the game loop during these animation blocks will be MUCH simpler
    - DEFINITELY need to use fsm to simplify managing state
