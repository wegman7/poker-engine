what do we want engine to be able to do?

Player
    Attributes:
        - seat_id
        - user
        - sitting_out
        - chips
        - chips_in_pot
        - time_bank
        - hole_cards

    Methods:
        Queue that is processed between hands
        - join (with chips)
        - leave
        - sitin/standup/addchips (make separate queue for between hands)

        Queue that is processed during hands
        - bet/call/check/fold

State
    Attributes
        - time_bank_total
        - players (dict user: player or seat_id: player)
        - spotlight (linked list of players still in hand)
        - spotlightBetweenHands (linked list of all players)
        - between_hands (bool)

Engine
    - queue game_action
    - process game_action
    - queue sit_action
    - process sit_action
    - start hand
    - decide if game should start
    - post blinds
    - deal hand
    - end street
    - deal flop
    - deal turn
    - deal river
    - payout
    - rank hands
    - end hand (move dealer chip etc)


    - change players from seatId: player to user: player
    - then make sure we know which player joins first so that it will be consistent which player has the spotlight first each hand
    - then keep making player actions and adding as needed
    - also might make sense to go ahead and write the backend logic first and test with unit tests, then add the integration tests from the frontend
